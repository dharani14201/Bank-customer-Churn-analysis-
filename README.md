Customer churn analysis using Python and data visualization to identify key factors influencing customer retention and business growth.
# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior for a retail bank to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and to provide data-driven recommendations for improving retention.  

By understanding why customers leave, the bank can implement targeted strategies to enhance satisfaction and reduce churn.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify major predictors of customer churn.  
- Analyze customer demographics, account activity, and service usage.  
- Build data visualizations and churn prediction insights.  
- Provide actionable business recommendations.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn** (if used for modeling)
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn / Matplotlib
- **Dataset:** Bank Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle or internal)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identified churn patterns by demographics, balance, and product usage.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Created relevant variables like tenure groups, balance ranges, and engagement metrics.  
4. **Modeling (Optional)** – Applied Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest to predict churn.  
5. **Insights & Recommendations** – Proposed strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with **low tenure** and **low account balance** are more likely to churn.  
- **High product holding** correlates with higher retention.  
- **Geography and gender** show notable churn differences.  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Implement targeted loyalty programs for low-tenure customers.  
- Introduce balance-based incentives or savings programs.  
- Personalize outreach campaigns for at-risk customer groups.

---

## 📈 Results
- Improved churn prediction accuracy up to **XX%**.  
- Identified top 5 features influencing churn.  
- Delivered actionable recommendations that could reduce churn by **X–Y%**.
